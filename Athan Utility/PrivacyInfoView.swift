 I developed this ad-free, 100% private athan app
 because athan apps have no reason to collect our muslim brothers and sisters' data.
 Athan Utility calculates everything on-device. When given permissions, iOS location
 services simply allow athan utility to conveniently refresh
 calculation coordinates so that you don't have to enter approximate coordinates
 every time you visit a new city. By Allah, this app will never be allowed to betray
 its users.
 
 Athan Utility's code is public for viewing at github.com/oalejel/athan-utility.
 You can verify that Athan Utility does not collect or share any user data by
 downloading and running the app on your device with Xcode. You can also read through
 my exasperated code commit messages at your leisure. You could probably prove that athan utility works without sharing data
 by scanning for outgoing http requests from athan utility (there are none).
 
 If you have any doubts about athan utility, please reach out to me on twitter @oalejel or
 email me with the feedback button.
 
 If you enjoy using Athan Utility, please share it with friends and give it a review on the app store!
