#  Todo list 

- consider whether user with no cellular data but with GPS should have app automatically put in new coordinates without name of place... maybe its for the best!
- add settings for prayer calculation method. api has about a dozen methods to pick from. a uipickerview in the settings panel will do. also specify the method somewhere in the main page to make the app as informative as possible.
