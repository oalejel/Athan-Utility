#  Todo list 
Before updating 
- run with breakpoints everywhere to confirm control flow 
- keep swiftui from updating literally everything when the qibla view rotates. some states should not update everything 

For later 
- dragging up on times table should bring up a monthly times table instead of just tomorrow times. nobody cares about tomorrow's times!
- allow users to add additional locations, and set one of the options as the "my location" for notifications and stuff
- be more efficent with notifications by not wasting notification budget on notifications from earlier in the day
