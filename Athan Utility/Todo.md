#  Todo list 
Before updating 
- run with breakpoints everywhere to confirm control flow 
- keep swiftui from updating literally everything when the qibla view rotates. some states should not update everything 
- if custom alert time is longer than interval between two prayers, then use 15 minutse instead
- make sure notifications are always recalcualted when locations are changed
- get timezone of custom locations OR just tell user that the times they see are according to their iphone's timezone
- find out why main ui is refreshed every second
- fix thing where location re-pans on the first try in custom mode 

- test on ios 13 
- test on ios 12 
- test on iphone X and Xr and mini 
- test on iphone 7 ios 14, 13, and 12
- add review request after foreground in ios (ensure not widget) is opened for the third time

For later 
- dragging up on times table should bring up a monthly times table instead of just tomorrow times. nobody cares about tomorrow's times!
- allow users to add additional locations, and set one of the options as the "my location" for notifications and stuff
- be more efficent with notifications by not wasting notification budget on notifications from earlier in the day
